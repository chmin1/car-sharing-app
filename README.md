# *Merge*

**Merge** is a car sharing app created with college students in mind

Many college students find themselves travelling to the same places often but don't have ways coordinating trips together. Merge looks to fix that by giving students a space where they can see, join and coordinate trips together, reducing the price of travelling. 

## Functionality

With this app, users can:

- [x] Sign up using their school name and .edu address
- [x] Login using .edu address and password
- [x] View and search a timeline of trips by destinations and time
- [x] View specific trip details and request to join/change a trip
- [x] Create new trips of their own if they can't find a trip to join
- [x] See notifications where they can approve edits or new members to a trip
- [x] Use messaging to communicate with other members in a trip
- [x] View all of your trips
